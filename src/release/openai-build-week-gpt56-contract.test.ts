/**
 * Issue #59 assumptions:
 * - Public evidence records a privacy-safe fingerprint of the retained private
 *   Codex ledger; it never publishes the session ID, raw prompts, or transcript.
 * - Meaningful use is evidenced by the primary build thread and concrete
 *   qualifying commits, not by adding a prose claim after the work.
 * - Repository copy and timestamped narration are canonical inputs for the
 *   external Devpost/video artifacts, whose publication is verified by #54/#60.
 * - GPT-5.6 was a build-time Codex model, not a Signmos runtime dependency.
